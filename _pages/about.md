Welcome to my homepage. I am Quanzeng You. Currently, I am a research scientist at ByteDance working on Computer Vision. Before that, I am a researcher at Microsoft Azure Computer Vision Science Group.

I received my Ph.D. degree from Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester. My Ph.D. advisor is [Prof. Jiebo Luo](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/). I am broadly interested in computer vision, deep learning and multimedia content understanding.
